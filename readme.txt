For now, this is just a Blargboard plugin that shows subforums in forum lists but it will be an easy-to-use layout settings panel for Blargboard one day.

How to install:
0) Install Blargboard 1.2 if you haven't yet.
1) Place the Layoutmaster layout.php into the lib folder of your Blargboard 1.2 installation and overwrite the existing file.
2) Place the content of the plugins folder into the plugins folder of your Blargboard installation.
3) Enable the plugin(s) in the Admin panel.
